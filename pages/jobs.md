## Description 
We are looking for help writing an R based interface to the BETYdb API.

@sckott, @gsrohde, @phenolphtalein and @dlebauer implemented a few basic functions in the [rOpensci traits package](https://github.com/ropensci/traits/) that can be found in the file [R/betydb.R](https://github.com/ropensci/traits/blob/master/R/betydb.R).

### Tasks:

* Resolve  [open issues related to BETYdb in the traits package](https://goo.gl/bzRzw1).
* Implement new functionality
* Write well documented functions, tests, and vignettes

### Skills

* Package development
* Familiarity `httr` package  (minimum: read ["Best Practices for writing an API package" by Hadley Wickham](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)
* Familiarity with `testthat` package (minimum: read [Wickham chapter on tests](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html)

### References

* The [BETYdb API documentation](https://authorea.com/users/5574/articles/7062/_show_article#sec__colon__betyapi) includes example urls.
* [BETYdb website](https://betydb.org]
* [BETYdb source code](https://github.com/pecanproject/bety]
* [vignette from traits package demonstrating current functionality](https://github.com/ropensci/traits/blob/master/vignettes/betydb.Rmd)


## Miscellaneous Jobs: Open Issues, Features and Bugs:

These mostly require familiarity with Ruby-on-Rails, Jquery, Postgres, and PostGIS.

BETYdb is an open-source project and we always welcome contributions. Depending on the scope of the contribution, we have funding to implement specific features (e.g. the rOpensci traits package interface). See our list of open issues, and if there is one you want to take a shot at either a) go for it and submit a pull request or b) submit a bid for resolving one or more open issues to betydb@gmail.com (we don't have funding for all open issues, and availability of funds is variable).
