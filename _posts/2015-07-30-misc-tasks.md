## Open Issues

BETYdb is an open-source project and we always welcome contributions. Depending on the scope of the contribution, we have funding to implement specific features (e.g. the rOpensci traits package interface). See our list of open issues, and if there is one you want to take a shot at either a) go for it and submit a pull request or b) submit a bid for resolving one or more open issues to betydb@gmail.com (we don't have funding for all open issues, and availability of funds is variable).

These mostly require familiarity with Ruby-on-Rails, Jquery, Postgres, and PostGIS.

## This Website

This website isn't very user friendly owing to my recent introduction to jekyll bootstrap. At this point it doesn't need to be, but if you can help make the navigation or design more user friendly please submit a pull request!
