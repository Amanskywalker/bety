# Data Entry
## Getting Started

You will need to create the following accounts:
* Redmine https://ebi-forecast.igb.illinois.edu/redmine/account/register
* BETYdb https://www.betydb.org/signup
* GitHub https://github.com/
* Mendeley www.mendeley.com/

Then please read the [Data Entry Workflow](https://github.com/dlebauer/bety/wiki/Data_Entry_Workflow).

## 1. Overview
This the userguide for entering data into the BETYdb database. The goal of this guide is to provide a consistent method of data entry that is transparent, reproducible, and well documented. The steps here generally accomplish one of two goals. The first goal is to provide data in a consistent framework that is associated with the experimental methods, species, site, and other factors associated with the original study. The second goal is to provide a record of all the transformations, assumptions, and data extraction steps used to migrate data from the primary literature to the standardized framework of the database. This second goal not only supports the scientific value of the data itself, it also simplifies the Quality Assurance process. 

## 2. Using Mendeley
Mendeley provides a central location of the collection, annotation, and tracking of the journal articles that we use. Features of Mendeley that are useful to us include: 
* Collaborative annotation & notes sharing: see section 2.2
    * Text highlighter   
    * Sticky notes for comments in the text
    * Notes field for text notes in the reference documentation
* Read/ unread & favorites:
Papers can be marked as **read** or **unread**, and may be **stared.**
* Groups: see section 2.1
* Tagging
