This is a list of proposed constraints.  In most or all cases, these are the
actual SQL statements that could be used in a migration to alter the database is
such a way as to apply the constraint.



/* Proposed partial index on the species table.  A full uniqueness constraint
would require updating or eliminating all but one of the 162 rows where the
scientificname value is equal to the empty string.  (Many of these rows have a
commanname value designating types of plants.)
SEE GH issue #247. */

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_scientificname ON species(scientificname) WHERE NOT (scientificname = '');
