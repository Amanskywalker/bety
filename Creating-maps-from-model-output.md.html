<h3>Publishing a hosted tiled map service using a tile package</h3>
<p>(see <a href="http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/arcgisonline/index.html#/Publishing_a_hosted_feature_service_to_ArcGIS_Online_using_an_ArcMap_document/010q00000087000000/">ArcGIS website</a>:</p>
<p>ArcGIS for Desktop allows you to build tiles for a map document and store them in an easily transferrable tile package (.tpk) file. You can share a tile package on ArcGIS Online and choose to publish it as a hosted tiled map service. This workflow allows you to build the tiles using your own computing power, rather than your ArcGIS Online credits.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to publish a hosted tiled map service using a tiled package:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your map in ArcMap and ensure that it's using the WGS 1984 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) coordinate system.</li>
<li>Click Customize &gt; ArcMap Options &gt; Sharing and ensure that Enable ArcGIS Runtime tools is checked.
This enables the menu option you'll use in the next step.</li>
<li>In ArcMap, click File &gt; Share As &gt; Tile Package.</li>
<li>Configure all the settings in the substeps below. Other settings are left to your choosing.</li>
<li>In the Tile Package tab, choose Upload package to my ArcGIS Online account.</li>
<li>In the Tile Format tab, choose ArcGIS Online / Bing Maps / Google Maps as the Tiling Scheme.</li>
<li>In the Item Description tab, provide the items marked as required.</li>
<li>In the Sharing tab, make sure that the connection information for your ArcGIS Online account is correct.</li>
<li>Click Share.</li>
</ol>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@ tips
One tip for creating tile package, when you edit the tile format, choose the highest level of detail smaller than the default, which is 20. I chose 10, which gives us enough details and allows us to create a tile within minutes.</p>
<p>You may be prompted to save your map before the tile package can be created.
It can take a while for a tile package to be generated, especially if you have included large scales.</p>
<h6>###########################publish online</h6>
<ol>
<li>When your tile package has finished generating, log in to your ArcGIS Online organizational account and click My Content.</li>
<li>Click your tile package to display its item details page.</li>
<li>Click Publish.</li>
<li>Type a title and tags and click Publish.
      The tiles are unpacked and hosted as a service. You should be able to see the service in the My Content page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've verified the service is running, you can optionally delete the original tile package so that you don't have to pay credits to store it.</p>
<p>Now you can add the newly generated tile to a map (either existed or new)</p>
<p>Open the map, click content, you should be able to see all the layers of the tile
Click the layer for which you want to pop-up data, then select "enable pop-up"</p>
<p>from the new enable pop up window, select the features you created before from a csv file.</p>

<h2>Google Fusion Tables</h2>
<ol>
<li>Format data as desired (this will be the same table that users will see in tooltips and download)
** numbers should have appropriate precision (e.g. two decimal places by default)</li>
</ol>
<h3>County Level Data</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a column in Excel called "County State", </li>
<li>fill it with the equations <code>=concatenate(&lt;col with county&gt;, " ", &lt;col with state&gt;)</code></li>
<li>save as .csv</li>
<li>Open <a href="http://drive.google.com">Google Drive</a></li>
<li>Create new Fusion Table</li>
<li>Upload Data </li>
<li>File -&gt; Geocode</li>
<li>Set Location Column to "County State"</li>
</ol>
