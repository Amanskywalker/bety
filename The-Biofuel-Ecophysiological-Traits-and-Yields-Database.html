<h2 id="background">2. Background</h2>
<p>A major motivation of the biofuel industry is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by providing ecologically and economically sustainable sources of fuel and dependence on fossil fuel. The goal of this database is to provide a clearinghouse of existing research on potential biofuel crops, to provide a source of data on plant ecophysiological traits and yields, and to present ecosystem scale re-analysis and forecasts that can support the agronomic, ecological, policy, and economic aspects of the biofuel industry. This database will facilitate the scientific advances and assessments that this transition will require.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">3. Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes the purpose, design, and use of the Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields database (BETYdb). BETYdb is a database of plant trait and yield data that supports research, forecasting, and decision making associated with the development and production of cellulosic biofuel crops. While the content of BETYdb is agronomic, the structure of the database itself is general and can therefore be used more generally for ecosystem studies.</p>
<p>BETY-db can be accessed online at <a href="http://ebi-forecast.igb.uiuc.edu/bety/">ebi-forecast.igb.uiuc.edu/bety/</a>. For developers interested in the database description in SQL syntax, e.g. to explore, create, and modify its structure, the <a href="https://github.com/dlebauer/BETYdb/raw/master/betydb_schema.sql">betydb_schema</a> is available. or further information about the procedures that are used to enter data into the database, see the accompanying <a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/dlebauer/www/dbdocumentation_data_entry.pdf">Data Entry Workflow</a>.</p>
<h3 id="objectives">3.1 Objectives</h3>
<p>The objectives of this database are to allow other users access data that has been collected from previously published and ongoing research in a consistent format, and to provide a streamlined interface that allows users to enter their own data. These objectives will support specific research and collaboration, advance agricultural practices, and inform policy decisions. Specifically, BETYdb supports the following uses:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Carry out statistical analyses to explore the relationships between traits</p></li>
<li><p>Identify differences among species and functional groups</p></li>
<li><p>Access BETY-db from simulation models to look up values for traits and parameter</p></li>
<li><p>Identify gaps in knowledge about biofuel crop traits and model parameters to aid rational planning of research activities</p></li>
</ol>
<p>BETYdb provides a central clearinghouse of biofuel crop physiological traits and yields in a consistently organized framework that simplifies the use of these data for further analysis and interpretation. Scientific applications include the development, assessment, and prediction of crop yields and ecosystem services in biofuel agroecosystems. The database directly supports parameterization and validation of ecological, agronomic, engineering, and economic models. The initial target end-users of BETY-db version 1.0 are users within EBI who aim to support sustainable biofuel production through statistical analysis and ecological modeling. By streamlining the process of data summary, we hope to inspire new scientific perspectives on biofuel crop ecology that are based on a comprehensive evaluation of available knowledge.</p>
<p>Published data and analyses will be provided to other scientists and the public in an easy to understand, interactive web front end to the database.</p>
<h2 id="scope">4. Scope</h2>
<p>The database contains trait, yield, and ecosystem service data. Because all plants have the potential to be used as biofuel feedstock, BETYdb supports data from all plant species. In practice, the species included in the database reflect available data and the past and present research interests of contributors. Trait and yield data are provided at the level of species, with cultivar and clone information provided where available.</p>
<p>The yield data not only includes end of season harvestable yield, but also includes measurements made over the course of the growing season. These yield data are useful in the assessment of historically observed crop yields, and they can also be used in the validation of plant models. Yield data includes peak biomass, harvestable biomass, and the biomass of the crop throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>The trait data represent phenotypic traits; these are measurable characteristics of an organism. The primary objective of the trait data is to allow researchers to model second generation biofuel crops such as Miscanthus and Switchgrass. In addition, these data enable evaluation of new plant species as potenial biofuel crops. Ecosystem service data reflect ecosystem-level observations, and these data are included in the traits table.</p>
<h3 id="data-content">4.1 Data Content</h3>
<p>BETYdb includes data obtained through extensive literature review of target species in addition to data collected from the Energy Farm at the University of Illinois, and by our collaborators. The BETYdb database contains trait and yield data for a wide range of plant species so that it is possible to estimate the distribution of plant traits for broad phylogenetic groups and plant functional types.</p>
<p>BETYdb contains data from intensive efforts to find data for specific species of interest as well as from previous plant trait and yield syntheses, and other databases. Most of the data currently in the database is from plant groups that are the focus of our current research <a href="#Table%201">Table 1</a>. These species include perennial grasses, such as Miscanthus (<em>Miscanthus sinensis</em>) Switchgrass (<em>Panicum virgatum</em>), and sugarcane (<em>Saccharyn</em> spp.). BETY also includes short-rotation woody species, including poplar (<em>Populus</em> spp.) and willow (<em>Salix</em> spp.) and a group of species that are being evaluated at the energy farm as novel woody crops. In addition to these herbaceous species, we are collecting data from a species in an experimental low-input, high diversity prairie.</p>

<h3 id="design">4.2 Design</h3>
<p>BETYdb is a relational database that comprehensively documents available trait and yield data from diverse plant species <a href="#Figure%201">Figure 1</a>. The underlying structure of BETY-db is designed to support meta-analysis and ecological modeling. A key feature is the PFT (plant functional type) table which allows a user to group species for analysis. On top of the database, we have created a web-portal that targets a larger range of end users, including scientists, agronimists, foresters, and those in the biofuel industry.</p>
<h3 id="web-interface">Web Interface</h3>
<p>The web interface to BETYdb provides an interactive portal in which available data can be visualized, accessed, and entered <a href="#Figure%202">Figure 2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="data-entry">Data Entry</h3>
<p>The [Data Entry Workflow | Data-Entry-Workflow-for-the-Biofuel-Ecophysiological-Traits-and-Yields-Database-(BETYdb] provides a complete description of the data entry process. BETY’s web interface has been developed to facilitate accurate and efficient data entry. This interface provides logical workflow to guide the user through comprehensively documenting data along with species, site information, and experimental methods. This workflow is outlined in the BETYdb Data Entry. Data entry requires a login with <code>Create</code> permissions, this can be obtained by contacting <script type="text/javascript">

<p><a id="Section 5"></a> ## 5. Tables</p>
<p>The database is designed as a relationship database management system (RDBMS), following the normalization [Figure 1] (#Figure 1). Each table has a primary key field, <code>id</code>, which is a unique identifier for each record in the table. In addition, each record has <code>created_at</code> and <code>updated_at</code> fields. The traits and yields tables each has a <code>user_id</code> field to record the user who originally entered the data.</p>
<p>A complete list of tables is provided in <a href="#Table%202">Table 2</a>, and a comprehensive description of the contents of each table is provided below.</p>
<p><a id="Table 2"></a><br />[Alt text] (figures/ug table 2.png &quot;Table 2&quot;)</p>
<h3 id="table-and-field-naming-conventions">5.1 Table and field naming conventions</h3>
<p>Each table is given a name that describes the information that it contains. For example, the table containing trait data is called <code>traits</code>, the table containing yield data is <code>yields</code>, and so on. Each table also has a <em>primary key</em>; the primary key is always <code>id</code>, and the primary key of a specific table might be identified as <code>yields.id</code> . One table can reference another table using a <em>foreign key</em>; the foreign key is given a name using the singular form of the foreign table, and underscore, and id, e.g. <code>traits_id</code> or <code>yields_id</code>.</p>
<p>In some cases, two tables can have multiple references to one another, known as a ’many to many’ or ’m:n’ relationship. For example, one citation may contain data from many sites; at the same time, data from a single site may be included in multiple citations. Such relationships use lookup tables. Lookup tables (e.g. <a href="#Table%204">Table 4</a>, <a href="#Table%205">Table 5</a>, <a href="#Table%2010">Table 10</a>, <a href="#Table%2012">Table 12</a>, <a href="#Table%2013">Table 13</a>) combine the names of the two tables being related, in the case of this example, the table used to link <code>citations</code> and <code>sites</code> is named <code>citations_sites</code>. These lookup tables have two foreign keys, e.g. <code>citation_id</code> and <code>site_id</code> but do not have a primary key The foreign keys are identified by <code>FK: table.column</code> in the comment fields of the database tables where <code>table</code> is either a) for 1:many relationships the name of the master table in which <code>column</code> is the primary key or b) for many to many (m:n) relationships, to the auxillary table with <code>column</code> adjacent to another column with which the m:n relationship is simplified into 1:m and 1:n relationships.</p>
<h3 id="data-tables">5.2 Data Tables</h3>
<p>The two data tables, <strong>traits</strong> and <strong>yields</strong>, contain the primary data of interest; all of the other tables provide information associated with these data points. These two tables are structurally very similar as can be seen in <a href="#Table%2017">Table 17</a> and <a href="#Table%2020">Table 20</a>.</p>
<h4 id="traits">traits</h4>
<p>The <strong>traits</strong> table contains trait data (<a href="#Table%2017">Table 17</a>). Traits are measurable phenotypes that are influenced by a plants genotype and environment. Most trait records presently in BETY describe tissue chemistry, photosynthetic parameters, and carbon allocation by plants.</p>
<h4 id="yields">yields</h4>
<p>The <strong>yields</strong> table includes aboveground biomass in units of Mg ha<span class="math">\(^{-1}\)</span> (<a href="#Table%2020">Table 20</a>). Biomass harvested in the fall and winter generally represents what a farmer would harvest, whereas spring and summer harvests are generally from small samples used to monitor the progress of a crop over the course of the growing season. Managements associated with Yields can be used to determine the age of a crop, the fertilization history, harvest history, and other useful information.</p>
<h3 id="auxillary-tables">5.3 Auxillary Tables</h3>
<h4 id="sites">sites</h4>
<p>Each site is described in the <strong>sites</strong> table (<a href="#Table%2015">Table 15</a>). A site can have multiple studies and multiple treatments. Sites are identified and should be used as the unit of spatial replication; treatments are used identify independent units within a site, and these can be compared to other studies at the same site with shared management. ’’Studies’’ are not identified explicitly but independent studies can be identified via shared management entries at the same site.</p>
<h4 id="treatments">treatments</h4>
<p>The <strong>treatments</strong> table provides a categorical identifier of a study’s experimental treatments, if any (<a href="#Table%2018">Table 18</a>).</p>
<p>Any specific information such as rate of fertilizer application should be recorded in the managements table (section. A treatment name is used as a categorical (rather than continuous) variable, and the name relates directly to the nomenclature used in the original citation. The treatment name does not have to indicate the level of treatment used in a particular treatment - if required for analysis, this information is recorded as a management.</p>
<p>Each study includes a control treatment, when there is no experimental manipulation, the treatment is considered ’observational’ and listed as control. In studies that compare plant traits or yields across different genotypes, site locations, or other factors that are built in to the database, each record is associated with a separate cultivar or site so these are not considered treatments.</p>
<p>For ambiguous cases, the control treatment is assigned to the treatment that best approximates the background condition of the system in its non-experimental state, for this reason, a treatment that approximates conventional agronomic practice may be labeled ’control’.</p>
<h4 id="managements">managements</h4>
<p>The <strong>managements</strong> table provides information on management types, including planting time and methods, stand age, fertilization, irrigation, herbicides, pesticides, as well as harvest method, time and frequency.</p>
<p>The <strong>managmenets</strong> and <strong>treatments</strong> tables are linked through the <code>managements_treatments</code> lookup (<a href="#Table%2010">Table 10</a>).</p>
<p>Managements are distinct from treatments in that a management is used to describe the agronomic or experimental intervention that occurs at a specific time and may have a quantity whereas Treatment is a categorical identifier of an experimental group. Managements include actions that are done to a plant or ecosystem, for example the planting density or rate of fertilizer application.</p>
<p>In other words, managements are the way a treatment becomes quantified. Each treatment can be associated with multiple managements. The combination of managements associated with a particular treatment will distinguish it from other treatments. Each management may be associated with one or more treatments. For example, in a fertilization experiment, planting, irrigation, and herbicide managements would be applied to all plots but the fertilization will be specific to a treatment. For a multi-year experiment, there may be multiple entries for the same type of management, reflecting, for example, repeated applications of herbicide or fertilizer.</p>
<h4 id="covariates">covariates</h4>
<p>The <strong>covariates</strong> table is used to record one or more covariates associated with each trait record (<a href="#Table%206">Table 6</a>). Covariates generally indicate the environmental or experimental conditions under which a measurement was made. The definition of specific covariates can be found in the <strong>variables</strong> table (<a href="#Table%2019">Table 19</a>). Covariates are required for many of the traits because without covariate information, the trait data will have limited value.</p>
<p>The most frequently used covariates are the temperature at which some respiration rate or photosynthetic parameter was measured. For example, photosynthesis measurements are often recorded along with irradiance, temperature, and relative humidity.</p>
<p>Other covariates include the size or age of the plant or plant part being measured. For example, root respiration is usually measured on fine roots, and if the authors define fine root as &lt;2mm, the covariate root_minimum_diameter has a value of <span class="math">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="pfts">pfts</h4>
<p>The plant functional type (PFT) table, <strong>pfts</strong> is used to group plants for statistical modeling and analysis. Each record in <strong>pfts</strong> contains a PFT that is linked to a subset of species in the <strong>species</strong> table. This relationship requires the lookup table <strong>pfts_species</strong> (<a href="#Table%2013">Table 13</a>). Furtheromre, each PFT can be associated with a set of trait prior probability distributions in the <strong>priors</strong> table (<a href="#Table%2014">Table 14</a>). This relationship requires the lookup table <strong>pfts_priors</strong> (<a href="#Table%2012">Table 12</a>).</p>
<p>In many cases, it is appropriate to use a pre-defined default PFT (e.g. <code>tempdecid</code> is temperate deciduous trees) In other cases, a user can define a new pft to query a specific set of priors or subset of species. For example, there is a PFT for each of the functional types found at the EBI Farm prairie. Such project-specific PFTs can be defined as <code>`projectname`.`pft`</code> (i.e. <code>ebifarm.c4grass</code> instead of <code>c4grass</code>).</p>
<h4 id="variables">variables</h4>
<p>The <strong>variables</strong> table includes definitions of different variables used in the traits, covariates, and priors tables (<a href="#Table%2019">Table 19</a>). Each variable has a <code>name</code> field, and is associated with a standardized value for <code>units</code>. The <code>description</code> field provides additional information or context about the variable.</p>
<h3 id="lookup-tables">5.4 Lookup Tables</h3>
<p>Lookup tables are required when each record on one table can be related to many records on another table, and vice-versa; this is called a ’many to many’ relationship.</p>
<h4 id="citations_sites">citations_sites</h4>
<p>Because a single study can use multiple sites and multiple studies can use the same site, these relationships are tracked in the <strong>citation_sites</strong> table (<a href="#Table%204">Table 4</a>).</p>
<h4 id="citations_treatments">citations_treatments</h4>
<p>Because a single study can include multiple treatments and each treatment can be associated with multiple citations, these relationships are measured in <strong>citations_treatments</strong> table (<a href="#Table%205">Table 5</a>).</p>
<h4 id="managements_treatments">managements_treatments</h4>
<p>It is clear that one treatment can have many managements, e.g. tillage, planting, fertilization. It is also important to note that any managements applied to a control plot should, by definition, be associated with all of the treatments in an experiment; this is why the many-to-many lookup table <strong>managements_treatments</strong> is required.</p>
<h4 id="pfts_priors">pfts_priors</h4>
<p>The <strong>pfts_priors</strong> table allows a many to many relationship between the <strong>pfts</strong> and <strong>priors</strong> tables (<a href="#Table%2012">Table 12</a>). This allows each pft to be associated with multiple priors and each prior to be associated with multiple pfts.</p>
<h4 id="pfts_species">pfts_species</h4>
<p>The <strong>pfts_species</strong> table allows a many to many relationship between the <strong>pfts</strong> and <strong>species</strong> tables (<a href="#Table%2012">Table 12</a>).</p>
