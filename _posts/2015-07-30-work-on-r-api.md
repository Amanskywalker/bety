## Description 
We are looking for help writing an R based interface to the BETYdb API.

@sckott, @gsrohde, @phenolphtalein and @dlebauer implemented a few basic functions in the [rOpensci traits package](https://github.com/ropensci/traits/) that can be found in the file [R/betydb.R](https://github.com/ropensci/traits/blob/master/R/betydb.R).

### Tasks:

* Resolve  [open issues related to BETYdb in the traits package](https://goo.gl/bzRzw1).
* Implement new functionality
* Write well documented functions, tests, and vignettes

### Skills

* Package development
* Familiarity `httr` package  (minimum: read ["Best Practices for writing an API package" by Hadley Wickham](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)
* Familiarity with `testthat` package (minimum: read [Wickham chapter on tests](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html)
